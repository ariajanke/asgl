# Aria's Stupid/Superfluous/Silly GUI Library

A GUI library which can be used with games and provide a basis for building game menus.

This is a derivative of KSG. My plans and reasons for this library is a departure in interface and a name change.

While the demo applications work for the most part. This may not be yet suitable to replace KSG, and may have many bugs that I'm as of yet unaware.

## Unstable Interface Warning
Presently this project is in an "interface flux". I'm still trying to figure out a less than awful design for it.

## Present goals for this project
- Replace KSG completely
- Have "general" events like: cancel, accept, motion left/right/up/down
- Be as usable with controllers as with mouse and keyboard
- Make it possible to use other windowing/graphics facilities
